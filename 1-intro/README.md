Introduction to Node.js
=======================

Goals:

* Basic node.js project layout
* Node.js modules
* Setting up an express.js app
* Integrating node.js with mongodb

Homework
--------

Create a todo app that matches the following user stories.

* As a user, I can add a todo
* As a user, I can mark a todo as complete (crossed out)
* As a user, I can remove a todo

Bonus

* Use redis or leveldb instead
* Allow multiple browsers to update live with websockets (this one is probably super hard, we'll cover websockets later though so maybe come back to it)
